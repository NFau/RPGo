===================== Network ==========================

1st Approach:
  Client calculate next position
  Server validation (YES/NO)
  Client resync using server response

  Problems:
    -> If lag, players will jump
    -> Clients are always late (for smooth animation)

  Evolution:
    -> Server calculate what would have been the correct position
      -> Involve to have a LERP on front instead of a speed move

Major evolution:
  -> Propagate event to server at fixed time (every 100ms for exemple)
      ->  Dirty flag on players

Optimal:
  Server should receive a directional vector and should calculate the position
